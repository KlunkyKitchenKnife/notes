PHI, according to the [electronic Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-160/subpart-A/section-160.103), is defined as "individually identifiable health information" that is:
- transmitted by electronic media;
- maintained in electronic media; or
- transmitted or maintained in any other form or medium.

There are also exceptions from the definition provided, such as those from education records which are regulated under FERPA, employment records which are regulated under employment and anti discrimination laws, and those who have been dead for more than 50 years.

Further, ["individually identifiable health information"](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) is information, including demographic data, that relates to:

- the individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
- the provision of health care to the individual, or
- the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and
- that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).



Liability for Victims?

Often the victims of fraud that results from the compromise of PHI are not held liable for these fraudalent actions. However, that doesn't mean they also still dont experience the opportunity cost of spending time and energy to manage these actions, nor does it negate the extraneous expenses that can occur. The following are examples of such indirect costs:
- Lawyer fees: Varies depending on how long the case is and how experienced your lawyer is, but average rates sit at around $300/hr. For added context, some identity‑theft insurance products, like [Allstate Identity Protection](https://www.allstateidentityprotection.com/allstate-restoration-25k-summary-of-benefits) explicitly advertise coverage for attorney fees up to tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., $25,000–$100,000 caps) in serious cases, which is a signal that, in edge cases with litigation or criminal entanglement, legal fees can escalate very sharply. 
- Travel (to courts, lawyers offices, providers/insurers)
- Copying/postage: correcting insurance records often requires sending certified letters, dispute packets, and affidavits to providers, insurers, credit bureaus, and sometimes regulators. This is however not a very high cost compared to legal fees and time off work.
- Credit repair services
- Restoring insurance
- Lost wages from missed work
- Emotional and health impacts such as sstress, anxiety, sleep problems, depression, or PTSD-like symptoms
